              <p>
                Tour Help Desk offers you information about holiday destinations based on your
                personal preferences, such as nightlife, dining, nature and outdoors, sports,
                shopping, languages, climate, time of year, holiday duration, budget, port of
                departure, etc. (the "Services"). We aggregate information on holiday
                destinations from a variety of resources and rank it using our proprietary
                algorithm. Tour Help Desk strives to compound an up-to-date collection of travel
                warnings issued by government agencies and other official institutions. However,
                this information may not be complete. It is therefore recommended to consult the
                relevant government agency in your country of residence (Foreign Ministry,
                Embassy, etc.) prior to your departure.
